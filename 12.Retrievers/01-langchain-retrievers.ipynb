After the group stage, the top four teams, based on aggregate points, would advance to the playoffs. In this stage, the top two teams compete with each other (in a match titled \"Qualifier 1\"), as does the remaining two teams (in a match titled \"Eliminator\"). While the winner of Qualifier 1 would directly qualify for the final match, the losing team had another chance to qualify for the final match by competing against the winning team of the Eliminator (in a match titled \"Qualifier 2\"). The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2 match advanced to the final match.\n","The IPL Governing Council decided to keep the number of matches to 74 for this edition as it was in the previous three seasons to help the cricketers balance their workload; however, it will be increased to 84 from 2026 onwards with the return of the double round-robin format.\n","\n","\n","==== Rule changes ====\n","It was announced that the IPL will follow the International Cricket Council's (ICC) Code of Conduct regulations used for Twenty20 International (T20I) matches from 2025 onwards. The IPL had previously used its own Code of Conduct.\n","\n","\n","=== Schedule ===\n","According to ESPNcricinfo, the dates of the tournament window for the three seasons between 2025 and 2027 were sent to franchises ahead of the 2025 auction. In November 2024, the tentative dates for the three seasons were announced, with the 2025 edition set to take place from 14 March to 25 May. In January 2025, it was announced that the 2025 season would commence on 21 March to allow for a two-week gap after the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final scheduled to take place on 9 March. This led to a clash with the 2025 Pakistan Super League taking place from 11 April to 25 May 2025, which was moved from its typical February–March window for the same reason.\n","The first two matches were confirmed by the BCCI on 13 February 2025, with the inaugural match being hosted at the Eden Gardens between the defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bengaluru on 22 March. The complete fixtures were announced on 16 February. It was announced that both Qualifier 1 and Eliminator would be played at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium on 20 and 21 May, and that Qualifier 2 and final would be played at the Eden Gardens on 23 and 25 May, with the venue to host its third IPL final after 2013 and 2015.\n","\n","\n","==== Suspension and rescheduling ====\n","On 9 May 2025, the remaining matches were suspended due to the 2025 India–Pakistan crisis. The revised schedule was announced on 12 May, with the remaining matches resumed \n","content 2\n","The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 (T20) cricket league in India, organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Founded in 2007, it features ten city-based franchise teams. The IPL is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world and the 13th richest sporting league in the world by revenue. It is held annually between March and May. It has an exclusive window in the Future Tours Programme of the International Cricket Council, resulting in fewer international tours occurring during the seasons. It is also the most viewed Indian sports event, per the Broadcast Audience Research Council.\n","In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to broadcast live on YouTube. In 2014, it ranked sixth in attendance among all sports leagues. Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established. The IPL is the second-richest sports league in the world by per-match value, after the National Football League. In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next four seasons for US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports, which meant that each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million. As of 2025, there have been 18 seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the Royal Challengers Bengaluru, who won the 2025 season after defeating the Punjab Kings in the final.\n","A women's edition of the Indian Premier League, known as the Women's Premier League, was established in 2022 and had its first season in 2023.\n","\n","\n","== History ==\n","\n","\n","=== Background ===\n","In April 2007, Essel Group launched the Indian Cricket League (ICL) in partnership with IL&FS. The ICL was not recognized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC). Moreover, the BCCI was unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL executive board. In response, the BCCI increased the prize money for its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players who joined the ICL, which it considered a rebel league.\n","\n","\n","=== Foundation ===\n","On 13 September 2007, as the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 began, the BCCI launched the Indian Premier League, an annual franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition. The inaugural season was scheduled to start in April 2008, commencing with a \"high-profile ceremony\" in New Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL initiative, provided details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system, and squad composition rules. The league, to be managed by a seven-person governing council, would also serve as the qualifying mechanism for that year's Champions League Twenty20.\n","To determine team ownership, an auction for the franchises was held on 24 January 2008. The reserve prices for the eight franchises totalled $400 million, but the auction ultimately raised $723.59 million. The league officially commenced in April 2008, featuring Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Mumbai Indians (MI), Delhi Daredevils (DD), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), Deccan Chargers (DC), Rajasthan Royals (RR), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).\n","In 2009, the BCCI and other national boards offered amnesty to rival ICL's players and officials, provided they terminated their contracts. The resulting player exodus and financial difficulties forced ICL to shut down later that year.\n","\n","\n","=== Expansions and terminations ===\n","New franchises, Pune Warriors India and Kochi Tuskers Kerala, joined the league before the fourth season in 2011. The Sahara Adventure Sports Group purchased the Pune franchise for $370 million, while Rendezvous Sports World bought the Kochi franchise for $333.3 million. The Kochi franchise was terminated after just one season due to their failure to pay the BCCI the 10% bank guarantee element of the franchise fee.\n","In September 2012, the Deccan Chargers franchise agreement was terminated after the BCCI failed to find new owners. In October, an auction was held for a replacement franchise; Sun TV Netwo\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Vector Store Retriever\n","from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma\n","from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings, ChatHuggingFace\n","from langchain_core.documents import Document"],"metadata":{"id":"5kHOSI8QoIUX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769708405165,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4678,"user":{"displayName":"Vaibhav Bhanawat","userId":"07501707770941994407"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["embedding  = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"u1V03FqzpFfL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769708419172,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13997,"user":{"displayName":"Vaibhav Bhanawat","userId":"07501707770941994407"}},"outputId":"388a94b2-5982-44fd-c54b-9a4d4b8e8cbc"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["WARNING:torchao.kernel.intmm:Warning: Detected no triton, on systems without Triton certain kernels will not work\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/huggingface_hub/utils/_auth.py:94: UserWarning: \n","The secret `HF_TOKEN` does not exist in your Colab secrets.\n","To authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub, create a token in your settings tab (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), set it as secret in your Google Colab and restart your session.\n","You will be able to reuse this secret in all of your notebooks.\n","Please note that authentication is recommended but still optional to access public models or datasets.\n","  warnings.warn(\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Step 1: Your source documents\n","documents = [\n","    Document(page_content=\"LangChain helps developers build LLM applications easily.\"),\n","    Document(page_content=\"Chroma is a vector database optimized for LLM-based search.\"),\n","    Document(page_content=\"Embeddings convert text into high-dimensional vectors.\"),\n","    Document(page_content=\"OpenAI provides powerful embedding models.\"),\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"YevLvHGSpVly","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769708419183,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Vaibhav Bhanawat","userId":"07501707770941994407"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["vector_store = Chroma.from_documents(\n","    documents = documents,\n","    embedding = embedding,\n","    collection_name = 'my_collecions',\n","    persist_directory='/content/drive/MyDrive/ML-AI/GenAI/LangChain/code-base/retrievers/my_chroma'\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"ziC5zti8pgdh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769708424506,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5319,"user":{"displayName":"Vaibhav Bhanawat","userId":"07501707770941994407"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["vectorRetriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={'k' : 2})"],"metadata":{"id":"11gZHQpIp5AB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769708424806,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Vaibhav Bhanawat","userId":"07501707770941994407"}}},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["docs = vectorRetriever.invoke(\"What is Chroma used for?\")\n","for i, doc in enumerate(docs):\n","  print(f\"content {i + 1}\")\n","  print(doc)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9-512MMXqGaJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769708424911,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":94,"user":{"displayName":"Vaibhav Bhanawat","userId":"07501707770941994407"}},"outputId":"6e94a676-1cfa-4fe1-d355-db8154e22e62"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["content 1\n","page_content='Chroma is a vector database optimized for LLM-based search.'\n","content 2\n","page_content='Chroma is a vector database optimized for LLM-based search.'\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["result = vector_store.similarity_search(\"what us chroma sued for ?\", k = 2)\n","for i, doc in enumerate(result):\n","  print(f\"content {i + 1}\")\n","  print(doc)\n","  #
